# Emaily - email survey service for startups!
As part of my Udemy course for Full Stack Web Development, I created a platform using Node, React, Redux and Mongo among others, 
for startups to register, buy credits (test account on stripe) and as soon as you have credits, you would be able to use them to 
create surveys and send them to all your recipients list members (using sendgrid).
